Feature plugin for testing automatic rollback of a plugin or theme update failure.

## Description

This is a feature plugin based on the [PR](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/860) for [#51857](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51857).

The assumption is that most of the errors in large plugins/themes occur during the `copy_dir()` part of `WP_Upgrader::install_package()`. Trac ticket [#52342](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/52342) brought more error reporting to `copy_dir()` and Trac ticket [#52831](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/52381) provides a filter hook in order to process the rollback in the event of a plugin/theme update failure. As of WordPress 5.7-beta1 both of these tickets are in core.

It is during the `WP_Upgrader::install_package()` that the currently installed plugin is deleted in anticipation of copying the new update into that location. Having an empty plugin/theme folder or an incompletely copied update seems to be the most common issue.

There will be messaging in the event of an error and successful or unsuccessful rollback.

## Testing

There was much discussion regarding the thought that adding additional IO processes for the zip and unzip process could result in server timeout issues on resource starved shared hosts. Activating the feature plugin will result in the creation of a zipfile of the installed plugin/theme being updated.

For the sake of testing assume any server timeout occurring during the update process might be releated to the additional IO processes creating the zipfile. Please report these in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/afragen/rollback-update-failure/issues) and report your server details. ( Host, RAM, OS, etc. )

To simulate a failure, use the filter `add_filter( 'rollback_update_testing', '__return_true' );`

Alternatively you can install the [Rollback Update Testing](https://gist.github.com/afragen/80b68a6c8826ab37025b05d4519bb4bf) plugin, activating it as needed.
